#Chapter 10 Project

Problem Description:
(The Circle2D class) Design a class named Circle2D that contains: 

*	Two double data fields named x and y that specify the center of the circle with get methods.
*	A data field radius with a get method.
*	A no-arg constructor that creates a default circle with (0, 0) for (x, y) and 1 for radius.
*	A constructor that creates a circle with the specified x, y, and radius.
*	A method getArea() that returns the area of the circle.
*	A method getPerimeter() that returns the perimeter of the circle.
*	A method contains(double x, double y) that returns true if the specified point (x, y) is inside this circle. 
*	A method contains(Circle2D circle) that returns true if the specified circle is inside this circle. 
*	A method overlaps(Circle2D circle) that returns true if the specified circle overlaps with this circle.

Use the test program that 

* Create a Circle2D object c1 (new Circle2D(2, 2, 5.5)). 
* display its area and perimeter, 
* displays the result of c1.contains(3,3) 
* displays the result of c1.contains(new Circle2D(4, 5, 10.5)),
* displays the result of c1.overlaps(new Circle2D(3, 5, 2.3))

##Tasks
* Design: Draw an UML class diagram for the Circle2D class.
* Code: Implement the class and 
* Submit the files using git
